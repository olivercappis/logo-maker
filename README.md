# Logo Maker

## Description

This is a simple svg logo maker that was made largely for practice writing code to pass pre written tests.

## Usage

To use the logo generator just clone this repository and then run 'npm i', and 'node index'. follow the instructions from inquirer and that should be it.

## Credits

My instuctor provided the shapes.test.js file for us to then write code to pass those tests.
